    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the interest coverage ratio<br> 
    What is the interest coverage ratio?<br>
    the interest coverage ratio is a measurement of a compay's ability to pay it's debt payment's. It is sometimes called the times interest earned (TIE) ratio.<br>
    How to calculate interest coverage ratio?<br>
    To calculate interest coverage ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    interest coverage ratio = earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) / interest expens<br>
    example: company x's earnings in a specific quarter are $837,000 the company also has a debt and it should pay $39,000 every month to pay the total debt.<br>
    first we should convert the monthly interest payments into quarterly payments and we can do that by multiplying the monthly payments by three.<br>
    quarterly payments = $39,000 * 3<br>
    quarterly payments = $117,000<br>
    now let's calculate the interest coverage ratio:<br>
    interest coverage ratio = earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) / interest expens<br>
    interest coverage ratio = $837,000 / $117,000<br>
    interest coverage ratio = 7.15<br>
    Why use interest coverage ratio?<br>
    the interest coverage ratio is used to find out how easily a company can pay interest on it's outstanding debt. Lenders and investors usually use it to determine a company's riskiness relative to it's current debt or for future borrowing.<br>
